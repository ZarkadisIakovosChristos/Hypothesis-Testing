# Hypothesis-Testing
This repository contains information and material for the Hypothesis Testing, a personal project, which was created to fasten the hypothesis testing procedures for the course "Statistics II: Hypothesis Tests" (UNIPI, Department of Statistics and Insurance Science). The purpose of the project is to create functions for a great deal of hypothesis test, like UMP, GLRT and Asymptotic Tests. The project was written in R. It includes Two-Sided and all One-Sided scenarios for UMP (Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Exponential, Weibull, etc.), Asymptotic (Wald, Score, G2) and GLRT, for multi-parameter and one or two samples. It includes their critical function, p-values and power-estimation for a pre-determined parameter value, along with optimal sample selection for determining a desirable level of power.
